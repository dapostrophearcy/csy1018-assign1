     <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
       <p>I am in my first year at university, studying BSc Computing. My aim is to further my career path and pursue my interests.  Being well organised and focused helps me to attain my goals.  Managing my time is important to my studies and work to make certain that I achieve the best results. My experiences have encouraged me to use my initiative to resolve any situation.</p>

     <h2>Education</h2>
       <p>My studies have always steered me to towards computers, they are literally everywhere.  Computers make up such a large part of everthing we do that I have tried to focus on building my knowledge of how computers work and what they can achieve.  This lead me to study computing as a first choice (accompanied by Chemistry, Mathematics, and Graphics) during my A-Levels at the Island Innovation VI Centre on the Isle of Wight (2014-2016).  When applying for university computing was an easy choice. I have landed at the University of Northampton looking to further my options for my career choice, currently studying BSc Computing.</p>

     <h2>Coursework</h2>
       <p>Within my studies in Computing at A-Level I completed coursework that encorporated software engineering, problem solving, and databases.  Writing a program in Visual basic helped to develop my skills as a programmer and problem solver.  I found that working out a solution for a dance class company seemed closer to the world of computing than I had been before and knew this was the field for me.  Although at first designing a database proved to be arduous, it soon came together and I was happy with the result.  Report writing, although tedious, is a vital skill I have learnt from the project.</p>

     <h2>Work Experience</h2>
       <p>Describe your experience in work</p>

     <h2>Activities</h2>
       <p>
         Often dabbling in creative computing projects was what really got me hooked on PCs.  Whether it be playing around in Audacity and learning about audio, or making a simple game in GameMaker 8, to developing a website with HTML and CSS.  Since I have always used computers how they work and what they're made of piqued my curiosity. I decided to brave it and build my own PC in 2014, which helped me discover lots about the workings of computers.
       </p>

     <h2>Skills</h2>
       <p>I have got limited experience in HTML and CSS, also coding with VB.net using Visual Basic.  That I developed through personal interest, and education.</p>
